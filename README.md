# Module 12 challenge: Employee Tracker

## Description

This Module 12 Challenge repository was created to complete the Module 12 Challenge of the bootcamp.

This project aims to build a Content Management System (CMS) to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
User can manage the database by interacting with the terminal, choosing options like "Delete Employee" or "View All Departments" to 
select the options they want to perform.

## Installation

Please make sure to run the command "npm install" to install all required node modules before running the program. 
Please also make sure to run "schema.sql" for initializing the database, and "seeds.sql" testing.

## Usage

Please run the command "npm start" in terminal to start the command-line application.
